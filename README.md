# Employment-projections-project

This project examines the employment projections (growth) in the USA for 2021-2031 analyzing the fastest growing and largest declining occupation trends as well as analyzing the degree supply and demand to fill in the growing number of jobs for that decade.

The file, called Employment-Projections.csv, is available in the US Bureau of Labor Statistics website (https://data.bls.gov/projections/occupationProj).

This data represents the employment statistics in 2021 and the projection for the next 10 years (until 2031) based on multiple occupations. The data includes number of jobs in 2021, the median annual wage, projected number of jobs in 2031, typical entry level education, annual average occupation job openings and some other data which will be used for this analysis.
